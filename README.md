## Project Progression:

part 1
We started the project by scrapping a smaller data set:
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/listing.php
Take a look at: sgcarmart_used_car_frontpage in my repository
There are only 6 variables included.
As you can see the prediction using linear regression by single variable is extremely poor.

part 2
We decided to take on a larger data set and we are in progress scarping the webpage:
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=889278&DL=1000
There are about 14 data sets found in this page.
